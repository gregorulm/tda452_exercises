TDA 452: Functional Programming
Solution to Exercises

This directory contains solutions to the exercises that were part of
the fall 2013 offering of the course TDA452: Functional Programming
at Chalmers University of Technology.

Those exercises were voluntary. No academic credit was given, either,
which is why I'm uploading those files.

By itself, the files may not be particularly useful. However,
the course homepage [1] provides easy access to all five sets
of exercises.

Lastly, while the code has been cleaned up, I left some "junk" in
them for pedagogical reasons, such as alternative definitions of
entire functions, or some refactored expressions.
